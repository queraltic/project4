In this project I created my own API. This API will be able to receive information, store it, or serve it when needed.

Main goal: Create an API that:

Serves information to clients (in response to their GET requests).
Receives data from your clients (via their POST requests) and saves it to your own database.

**1.  Main Endpoint page for the API query:**
    http://127.0.0.1:9000/sql/
 
**2. Endpoint in order overall from 5 to 0:**
   http://127.0.0.1:9000/order/

**3. Endpoint of number of total reviews:**
    http://127.0.0.1:9000/total_reviews/

**4. Endpoint in order alfabelitically**
   http://127.0.0.1:9000/name/

**5. Endpoint route for posting a new review:**
   http://127.0.0.1:9000/insertreview/
